// Activity 1 Arithmetic operations

// task 1 Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console


const a = 20;
const b = 10;
const result = a+b;

// task 2 Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console

const a2 = 20;
const b2 = 10;
const result2 = a2-b2;
console.log(`the substraction of a2 and b2 is ${result2}`);

// task 3 Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console

const a3 = 3;
const b3 = 2;
const result3 = a3 * b3;
console.log(`the multiplication of a3 and b3 is ${result3} `);



// task 4 Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console

const a4 = 10;
const b4 = 2;
const result4 = a4 / b4;
console.log(`the division of a4 and b4 is ${result4} `);



// task 5 Write a program to find remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console

const a5 = 10;
const b5 = 2;
const result5 = a5 % b5;
console.log(`the remainder by dividing a5 by b5 is ${result5} `);



// Activity 2 Assignment operator 

// task 6 use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console
let a6 = 6;
a6 += 12;
console.log(`the total value of a6 after addition using += operator is ${a6}`);


// task 7 use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console
let a7 = 12;
a7 -= 6;
console.log(`the total value of a7 after subtraction using -= operator is ${a7}`);
