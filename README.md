30 Days JavaScript Challenge ðŸš€
Welcome to my 30 Days JavaScript Challenge repository! ðŸŽ‰

About the Challenge
Over the past 30 days, I committed myself to improving my JavaScript skills by diving into various core topics and solving numerous JavaScript problems. This challenge pushed me to tackle both foundational and advanced concepts, building my knowledge incrementally. While I faced challenges along the way, I stayed persistent and kept going, even after a few breaks. This repository documents the problems I solved, with code examples and explanations, to help others learn as well.

Goals (Achieved!)
Throughout this challenge, I worked through a wide range of topics, including:

Variables (var, let, const)
Data Types
Basic Operators
Control Structures (if-else, switch)
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Function Declarations and Expressions
Arrow Functions
Closures
Arrays and Array Methods
Destructuring
Classes
Modules (import/export)
Promises and Async/Await
Error Handling
Selecting and Manipulating DOM Elements
Basic Data Structures and Algorithms
Local Storage
Regular Expressions
Recursion
Each topic offered its own challenges, and I practiced solving problems related to these concepts to deepen my understanding.

The Journey
This 30-day challenge was not without its struggles. There were times when my consistency broke, and I missed 4-5 days due to time constraints. But I didnâ€™t give up. I came back stronger, took the challenge seriously, and continued solving JavaScript questions diligently. Each break was a learning experience, and it taught me the importance of persistence and dedication in learning.

Daily Log
I documented my progress and solutions daily. You can check out my logs to follow along with the problems I tackled and review my solutions.

Conclusion
I have successfully completed the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge! ðŸŽ‰ The experience was both challenging and rewarding. Through problem-solving, I enhanced my JavaScript skills significantly. This journey reminded me that learning is not about perfection but perseverance, and Iâ€™m proud to have stayed committed to the challenge.

JavaScript is vast, and even though the 30 days are over, my journey as a learner is far from finished. Iâ€™m excited to keep pushing myself, exploring new concepts, and growing as a developer!

Thank you for following along, and happy coding! âœ¨
